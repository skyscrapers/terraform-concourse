# terraform-concourse

Terraform module to setup Concourse CI. This repository contains the following modules:
* `keys`: Creates an S3 bucket and uploads an auto-generated set of keys for concourse.
* `ecs-web`: ECS based setup for the Concourse web service, which is currently
  the combination of the ATC and TSA.
  (See the [Concourse Architecture](http://concourse.ci/architecture.html)
  documentation what these acronyms mean)
* `ecs-worker`: ECS based setup for a (pool of) Concourse worker(s).
* `ec2-worker`: EC2 based setup for a (pool of) Concourse worker(s).

## keys
Creates an S3 bucket and uploads an auto-generated set of keys for concourse.

The following resources are created:
- S3 bucket for concourse keys
- Uploads concourse keys to bucket

### Available variables
* [`environment`]: String(required): the name of the environment these subnets belong to (prod,stag,dev)
* [`name`]: String(required): The name of the Concourse deployment, used to distinguish different Concourse setups
* [`concourse_keys_version`]: Integer(optional): Change this if you want to re-generate the Concourse keys
* [`aws_profile`]: String(optional): This is the AWS profile name as set in the shared credentials file. Used to upload the Concourse keys to S3. Omit this if you're using environment variables.

### Outputs
* [`keys_bucket_id`]: String: The id (name) of the S3 bucket where the concourse keys are stored.

## ecs-worker
This setups Concourse CI workers on an ECS cluster.
This setups the following resources:
- Concourse Worker ECS service

**Warning**: due to an [issue with Concourse](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/544), it's recommended to run the workers on a `btrfs` formatted volume. This module **won't** setup that volume on the ECS instances for you, so unless the EC2 instances forming your ECS cluster already have their root disks formatted as `btrfs`, we advise to use the [`ec2-worker`](#ec2-worker) module instead.

### Available variables
 * [`environment`]: String(required): the name of the environment these subnets belong to (prod,stag,dev)
 * [`name`]: String(required): The name of the Concourse deployment, used to distinguish different Concourse setups
 * [`ecs_cluster`]: String(required): name of the ecs cluster
 * [`concourse_hostname`]: String(required): hostname on what concourse will be available, this hostname needs to point to the ELB.
 * [`concourse_docker_image`]: String(optional): docker image to use to start concourse. Default is [skyscrapers/concourse](https://hub.docker.com/r/skyscrapers/concourse/)
 * [`concourse_version`]: String(required): the Concourse CI version to use
 * [`ecs_service_role_arn`]: String(required): IAM role to use for the service to be able to let it register to the ELB
 * [`concourse_worker_instance_count`]: Integer(optional): Number of containers running Concourse web
 * [`backend_security_group_id`]: String(required): Security groups of the ECS servers
 * [`keys_bucket_id`]: String(required): The id of the bucket where the concourse keys are stored for connecting to the TSA.
 * [`keys_bucket_arn`]: String(required): The ARN of the bucket where the concourse keys. Used to allow access to the bucket.

### Output
None
