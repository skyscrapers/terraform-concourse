# terraform-concourse

[![ci.skyscrape.rs](https://ci.skyscrape.rs/api/v1/teams/skyscrapers/pipelines/terraform-modules/jobs/test-terraform-concourse-master/badge)](https://ci.skyscrape.rs/teams/skyscrapers/pipelines/terraform-modules?groups=terraform-concourse)

Terraform module to setup Concourse CI. This repository contains the following modules:

* `keys`: Creates an S3 bucket and uploads an auto-generated set of keys for concourse.
* `ecs-web`: ECS based setup for the Concourse web service, which is currently
  the combination of the ATC and TSA.
  (See the [Concourse Concepts](https://concourse-ci.org/concepts.html)
  documentation what these acronyms mean)
* `ec2-worker`: EC2 based setup for a (pool of) Concourse worker(s).
* `vault-auth`: Sets up the required resources in Vault so it can be integrated in Concourse

## keys

Creates an S3 bucket and uploads an auto-generated set of keys for concourse.

The following resources are created:

* S3 bucket for concourse keys
* Uploads concourse keys to bucket

### Available variables

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| bucket_force_destroy | A boolean that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are not recoverable | string | `false` | no |

| environment | The name of the environment these subnets belong to (prod,stag,dev) | string | - | yes |
| generate_keys | If set to `true` this module will generate the necessary RSA keys with the [`tls_private_key`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/tls/r/private_key.html) resource and upload them to S3 (server-side encrypted). **Be aware** that this will store the generated *unencrypted* keys in the Terraform state, so be sure to use a secure state backend (e.g. S3 encrypted), or set this to `false` and generate the keys manually | string | `true` | no |

### NOTE on the external EBS volume

The EC2 instances created by this module will include an external EBS volume that will automatically be attached and mounted. You should pay special attention to the device name that those volumes will have inside the OS once attached, as that name can vary depending on the instance type you selected. For example, in general for `t2` instances, if you attach the EBS volume as `/dev/xvdf` it'll have the same device name inside the OS, but on `m5` or `c4` instances that's not the case, as it'll be named `/dev/nvme1n1`.

As of now, this situation is not being handled automatically by the module, so depending on the instance type you select, you might have to change the internal device name via the variable `work_disk_internal_device_name`.

## vault-auth

This module sets up the needed Vault resources for Concourse:

* It creates a Vault policy that allows read-only access to `/concourse/*`
* It creates a Vault role in the aws auth method (which should be previously created - explained below) for Concourse and attaches the previously mentioned policy

### Available variables

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| additional_vault_policies | Additional Vault policies to attach to the Concourse role | string | `<list>` | no |
| concourse_iam_role_arn | IAM role ARN of the Concourse ATC server. You can get this from the concourse web module outputs | string | - | yes |
| vault_aws_auth_backend_path | The path the AWS auth backend being configured was mounted at | string | `aws` | no |
| vault_concourse_role_name | Name to give to the Vault role and policy for Concourse | string | - | yes |
| vault_server_url | The Vault server url | string | - | yes |
| vault_token_period | Vault token renewal period, in seconds. This sets the token to never expire, but it still has to be renewed within the duration specified by this value | string | `43200` | no |

### Output

--

### How to enable and configure the AWS auth method

If the AWS auth method is not previously enabled, you'll need to do it before applying this module. To do that you'll need to follow the first two steps described in the [official Vault documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws.html#via-the-cli).

* Enable the auth method
* Configure the AWS credentials so Vault can make calls to the AWS API. Note that you can skip this step if you're going to use Vault's IAM EC2 instance role to access the AWS API.
